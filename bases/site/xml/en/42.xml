      <portal>         <strong>SciELO - a model for cooperative                    electronic publishing in developing countries </strong> <p>           <span class="corpo">The access                      to adequate and up-to-date scientific and technical information                      is essential for the economic and social development, specially                      to support decision making process in planning, formulation                      and implementation of public policies and to support professional                      development and practice. The results of scientific research                      are mainly communicated and validated through publication                      in scientific journals. This is valid for developed and developing                      countries. However, scientific journals from developing countries                      face several distribution and dissemination barriers, which                      limits the access and usage of locally generated scientific                      information. </span></p> <p>           <span class="corpo">SciELO                      - Scientific Electronic Library Online is a model for cooperative                      electronic publishing of scientific journals on the Internet.                      Especially conceived to meet the scientific communication                      needs of developing countries, particularly Latin America                      and the Caribbean countries, it provides an efficient way                      to assure universal visibility and accessibility to their                      scientific literature, contributing to overcome the phenomena                      known as 'lost science'. In addition, the SciELO model comprises                      integrated procedures for the measurement of usage and impact                      of scientific journals.</span></p> <p>           <span class="corpo">SciELO Model                      is product of a partnership among FAPESP (<a href="http://www.fapesp.br/">http://www.fapesp.br</a>)–                      the State of São Paulo Science Foundation, BIREME (<a href="http://www.bireme.br/">http://www.bireme.br</a>)                      - the Latin America and Caribbean Center on Health                      Sciences Information, as well as national and international                      institutions related to scientific communication and editors.                      A pilot project, involving 10 Brazilian journals from different                      subject areas, was successfully carried out from March 1997                      to May 1998, aimed at the development and evaluation of an                      adequate methodology for electronic publishing on the Internet.                      From June 1998, the project begins to operate regularly, incorporating                      progressively new journal titles and expanding its operation                      to other countries. Since 2002, the Project is also supported                      by CNPq (<a href="http://www.cnpq.br/">http://www.cnpq.br</a>)                      - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e                      Tecnológico.</span><span class="corpo">                      </span></p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>The SciELO                      Model comprises three components.</strong>         </p> <p> </p> <p>The model's first                      component is the SciELO Methodology, which enables the electronic                      publication of complete editions of scientific journals, the                      organization of searchable bibliographical and full text databases,                      the preservation of electronic archives and the production                      of statistical indicators of the scientific literature usage                      and impact. The methodology includes also journal evaluation                      criteria based on international scientific communication standards.                      SciELO full texts are enriched with dynamic hypertext links                      with national and international data bases, as for example,                      LILACS and MEDLINE.</p> <p>The SciELO Model's second component is the application of                      the SciELO Methodology to operate web sites of collections                      of electronic journals. The SciELO Model envisages the operation                      of national sites as well as thematic sites. The pioneer application                      is the SciELO Brazil site (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/">             <span class="corpo">http://www.scielo.br</span></a>).                      Nowadays, Chile (<a href="http://www.scielo.cl/">http://www.scielo.cl</a>)                      and Cuba <span class="corpo"> (<a href="http://www.scielo.sld.cu/">http://www.scielo.sld.cu</a>)</span>                      are also operating applications regularly. Several other countries                      are evaluating and/or being trained on the SciELO Methodology.                      SciELO Public Health (<a href="http://www.scielosp.org/">             <span class="corpo">http://www.scielosp.org</span></a>           <span class="corpo">),                      a</span> regional thematic library covering Public Health                      scientific journals from Latin America and Spain, <span class="corpo">was                      launched in December 1999.

The general goal of the SciELO Project is to contribute to                      the development of the national scientific research by improving                      and expanding its means of dissemination, publication, and                      evaluation through the intensive use of electronic publishing.</p> <p>In the short term, the SciELO Project intends to radically                      increase the national and international visibility, accessibility                      and credibility of the Latin American and Caribbean scientific                      publication, through the integrated publishing of national                      and regional collections of scientific journals on the Internet.                      In the long term, the project envisions to increase the impact                      of the scientific literature from these regions.</p> <p>In order to accomplish the SciELO Project objectives, it                      is essential the improvement of every aspect of the scientific                      communication in the country, seeking to identify, stimulate,                      and develop a core collection of scientific journals, in which                      the quality standards match international leading scientific                      journal standards. Therefore, the evaluation criteria for                      journals, as well as the policies and procedures for their                      application are a fundamental line of action for the SciELO                      Project.</p> <p>Aiming at contributing to the creation and development of                      the SciELO core collection of scientific journals, the specific                      goals of the SciELO Criteria include:</p> <blockquote> <ol type="a">     <li> providing data for the evaluation of national scientific                          journals in order to determine their admission to the                          SciELO collection;</li>     <li> monitoring the performance of the scientific journals                          included in the SciELO collection in order to determine                          their permanence in this collection;</li>     <li> producing performance indicators for the SciELO collection                          as a whole, and for each of its individual journals.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>The SciELO Criteria contents and application will follow                      the SciELO Project dynamics and, specially, the process of                      creating and developing the SciELO core collection.</p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>3 SciELO Consultancy Committee</strong>         </p> <p>Based on the SciELO Criteria, the Consultancy Committee will                      propose: </p> <ol type="a">     <li>                        the inclusion of new scientific journal titles in the                          SciELO collection;                     </li>     <li>                       the exclusion of scientific journal titles from the SciELO                          collection;                     </li>     <li>                       changes in the evaluation criteria of scientific journals                          for admission to and permanence in the SciELO collection;                     </li>     <li>                        performance indicators for the journals belonging to                          the SciELO collection to be published regularly;                     </li>     <li>                        the definition and enhancement of the Committee's operation,                          this way enabling the efficient fulfilment of the above                          goals.                     </li> </ol> <p>The Committee will be composed by representatives of the                      national scientific communication community. </p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>4 SciELO Collection Scope</strong>         </p> <p>The SciELO collection includes scientific journals which                      predominantly publish the results of original scientific research,                      and other original works, which contribute significantly to                      knowledge in the area covered by the journal.

      <portal>         <p>           <strong>Certification criteria for SciELO sites: criteria, policy and procedures to classify and certify sites from the SciELO Network</strong> </p> <p>           <strong>Version March 2008</strong> </p> <p>           <br/> <br/> <strong>1 Introduction</strong> </p> <p>This document aims to describe the criteria, policies and procedures adopted to evaluate and certificate SciELO Sites, available at the network Portal (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>), and to define the characteristics of the regular operation Sites, under development Sites and pilot Sites. </p> <p>The Scientific Electronic Library Online - SciELO - is a model for cooperative electronic publishing of scientific journals on the Internet, specially created for developing countries.</p> <p>The SciELO Model enables managing electronic scientific journal collections and comprises 3 components: SciELO Methodology, SciELO Site and SciELO Network.</p> <p>Applying the SciELO Model enables managing the electronic scientific journal network, through the organization of bibliographical and full text databases, the storing and preservation of electronic archives. </p> <p>Among the resources provided by the SciELO Model, besides the publication of full texts, we can highlight the production of statistical indicators of the scientific literature usage and impact, the operation of dynamic hypertext links and the bibliographical record exchange with national and international databases. SciELO also enables publishing support materials, such as graphics and colored images, audio and video.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that SciELO Methodology may be applied to operate any individual journal or any scientific journal collection. However, creating a collection recognized as a SciELO Site demands not only the use of SciELO Methodology, but also requires that the titles be selected according to previously defined quality criteria for SciELO Network sites. </p> <p>The journal collections that do not meet the SciELO quality criteria may be operated on the Internet through SciELO Methodology; however, in this case, they will not be recognized as a SciELO Site. </p> <p>For more information on the adoption of SciELO Methodology, refer to the documents 'Guide for the Installation of SciELO Sites' (<a href="/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=5">http://www.scielo.org<font face="Arial"> <font face="Arial">/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=5</font> </font>           </a>) and 'Training Workshop on SciELO Methodology' (<a href="/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=6">http://www.scielo.org<font face="Arial"> <font face="Arial">/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=6</font> </font>           </a>).</p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>2 SciELO Site</strong> <br/> <br/> SciELO Methodology is the first component of SciELO Model and includes policies, rules, guidelines, procedures and tools related to electronic publishing, as well as evaluation and selection of journals, besides preparing, marking, storing, publishing, preserving, and also hyperlinks to other sources of information, use control and impact of the scientific journals operated on SciELO Sites. </p> <p align="left">Applying the methodology consists of dealing with scientific journal texts through five modules, as shown on the figure below:</p> <p align="left"> </p> <p align="center">           <img height="300" alt="" width="436" src="/local/content/image/imagem.gif"/> <br/> </p> <p> </p> <p>The second component of the Model is the SciELO Site, which operates nationwide electronic journal collections or thematic decentralized collections, selected according to previously established criteria. The third component is the SciELO Network, which integrates individual SciELO Sites available at <a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>. </p> <p>The methodology is applied to create and operate collections of electronic scientific journals, organized according to geographic and/or thematic objectives. The selected collections that operate on the Internet under the methodology are SciELO Sites. </p> <p>SciELO Sites are classified as:</p> <p>           <strong>a. Regular operation site: </strong>         </p> <p>Sites available at the SciELO Network Portal (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>), under section 'Journals by Collection', and meet the site evaluation and certification criteria, as described bellow:</p> <p>1. National Institution responsible for coordinating and operating the SciELO Site, acting as Executive Secretariat;<br/> 2. Scope of the collection, defined and published on the site;<br/> 3. National SciELO Advisory Committee, established and under operation;<br/> 4. Journal selection criteria, defined and published on the site;<br/> 5. Minimum of four titles available, with at least the last two years of publication; <br/> 6. Defined URL, preferably with the structure http://www.scielo.siglasdopais;<br/> 7. Results of the journal selection published on the site;<br/> 8. Site operational quality proven from the <a href="/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=52&amp;item=3">SciELO Network Site Evaluation Guide</a>; <br/> 9. Operation of scientific journal collection according to SciELO Methodology at local server;<br/> 10. SciELO's Web Services installed, set up and in regular operation; and<br/> 11. Metadata Exporting procedures installed to allow indexing and retrieval on SciELO Portal.</p> <p>The national sites in regular operation must meet the criteria of this document within one year.</p> <p>           <br/> <strong>b. Under development site: </strong>         </p> <p>Sites available at the SciELO Network Portal (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>), under section 'Initiatives under development', which are in a periodic monitoring phase for future certification as regular operation sites.</p> <p>The operation is monitored by a partnership developed between SciELO Operational Coordination (BIREME/PAHO/WHO) and the team responsible for the operational development of the National or thematic SciELO Site.</p> <p>These sites feature: </p> <p>1. National Institution responsible for coordinating and operating the SciELO Site, acting as Executive Secretariat; <br/> 2. Scope of the collection, defined and published on the site;<br/> 3. National SciELO Advisory Committee, established and under operation;<br/> 4. Journal selection criteria, defined and published on the site;<br/> 5. Minimum of four titles available, with at least the last two years of publication; and<br/> 6. Defined URL, preferably with the structure http://www.scielo.sigladopais.</p> <p>The difference between regular operation sites and under development sites consists on meeting the criteria defined on items 7, 8 and 9 of this document.</p> <p>           <br/> <strong>c. Pilot Site:</strong> </p> <p>Sites that intend to integrate SciELO Network Brazil and are under implementation. </p> <p>They are characterized by:</p> <p>1. National Institution responsible for coordinating and operating the SciELO Site, acting as Executive Secretariat; and <br/> 2. Scope of the collection, defined and published on the site. </p> <p>The pilot sites will be classified as under development sites after meeting the criteria defined on items 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this document.</p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>3 Evaluation and certification criteria of sites from SciELO Network</strong> </p> <p>The evaluation and certification criteria of SciELO Sites were established aiming to:</p> <p>a. subsidize the SciELO Network site classification process into: regular operation sites, under development and pilot sites; and<br/> b. to generate performance indicators of the sites included in the SciELO Network.</p> <p>The criteria defined below are applicable to SciELO Sites operating under SciELO Methodology and are available at <a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>.</p> <p>           <strong>             <br/> 3.1 Selection and evaluation criteria for scientific journals </strong>         </p> <p>The selection and evaluation criteria for composing and maintaining national scientific journal collections will be defined according to the 'SciELO Criteria: criteria, policy and procedures for admission and permanence of scientific journals in the SciELO collection', available at <a href="/php/index.php?lang=en">             <font face="Arial">http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php?lang=en</font> </a>, which may be adapted to each country reality, regarding the following items:</p> <p>a. criteria for automatic admission journal in the collection; and<br/> b. periodicity and number of articles per year.</p> <p>           <br/> <strong>3.2 National SciELO Advisory Committee </strong>         </p> <p>The application of the SciELO Methodology in a SciELO Site requires the existence of a National Advisory Committee. Based on the application of journal selection criteria, it will have the following attributions:<br/> <br/> a. to include new scientific journal titles in the SciELO collection; <br/> b. to exclude scientific journal titles from the SciELO collection; <br/> c. to adjust the evaluation criteria of scientific journals for admission to and permanence in the SciELO collection, on the following items: 1) criteria for automatic admission journal in the collectio, 2) periodicity and number of articles per year;<br/> d. to define performance indicators for the journals belonging to the SciELO collection to be published regularly; <br/> e. to define and improve the Committee's operation in order to efficiently achieve the above mentioned goals; and<br/> f. To discuss and propose policies, programs, procedures and activities aiming to strengthen the collection. </p> <p>The Advisory Committee will be composed of up to four representatives of national science and technology institutions and communities directly related to national scientific communications, together with up to four editors of the national or thematic journals of SciELO Sites, who are elected by all the collection editors. The institutions and editors will be permanently represented. The national Institution responsible for coordinating and operating the SciELO Site is responsible for the Presidency of the National SciELO Advisory Committee.</p> <p>For multidisciplinary sites, it is recommended to have representatives from the thematic areas, such as: Agricultural Sciences, Biological Sciences, Exact Sciences and Human Sciences, indicating the respective deputy representatives.</p> <p>The policies for creating and maintaining electronic scientific journal collections in SciELO Sites will be defined by the respective national committees and will be published on the site pages.</p> <p>           <br/> <strong>3.3 National scientific journal collection scope </strong>         </p> <p>To make up the national electronic scientific journal sites, it is necessary to define the collection scope, based on specifications of the covered thematic area(s).</p> <p>Moreover, the collections belonging to the SciELO Sites will necessarily consist of scientific journals that predominantly publish articles resulting from original scientific research and other original significant contributions for the journal specific area. Peers must perform the review and approval process.</p> <p>The collection of each individual title at the SciELO Site must begin with its approval by the National Advisory Committee, and it is recommended to include the retrospective issues up to 1997, or as from the first issue for journals created after 1997. The texts may be written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, or any combination of these languages.</p> <p>           <strong>             <br/> 3.4 Site operational quality </strong>         </p> <p>The SciELO Site operational quality is checked by compliance with the following items:</p> <p>a. to obey the journal selection and evaluation criteria;<br/> b. to regularly update the site, including periodicity of the journals in o the collection;<br/> c. to correctly operate the interface, with integrity of the links and recovery;<br/> d. to keep the site available uninterruptedly;<br/> e. to provide the site with reasonable mean speed for access; and<br/> f. to include a minimum of four titles available, with at least the last two years of publication. </p> <p>For more details, refer to the items specified at the '<a href="/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=52&amp;item=3">SciELO Network Site Evaluation Guide</a>'.</p>                      </portal>

        <portal>The DTD module is composed by a set of DTDs (Document Type Definition), in compliance with ISO 8879-1986 (SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language) and ISO 12083-1994 (Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup) regulations.  SGML is the metalanguage used for the description of complete texts, and based on this language, DTDs used by FAPESP/BIREME Electronic Journal Project were defined.

This latter form infects predominantly the myocardium, smooth and skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. The present work describes for the first time the detection of amastigote forms of <em>T. cruzi</em> in the renal parenchyma of a kidney graft recipient one month after transplantation. The patient was serologically negative for Chagas'disease and received no blood transfusion prior to transplant. The cadaver donor was from an endemic area for Chagas'disease. The recipient developed the acute form of the disease with detection of amastigote forms of <em>T. cruzi</em> in the renal allograft biopsy and circulating trypomastigote forms. The present report demonstrates that T. cruzi can infect the renal parenchyma. This mode of transmission warrants in endemic areas of Chagas'disease.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">[/abstract]</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal">               <span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The element <em>keyword group</em> [keygrp] has the attributes <em>controlled vocabulary</em> [scheme] indicating if the keywords used to describe the article have been taken from any specific vocabulary such as the DeCS.

La trascendencia clínica de estas infecciones es aún mayor en los pacientes que se someten a trasplante de médula ósea u otros tipos de trasplantes: en un estudio realizado en 1995 por la <em>European Bone</em>               <em> Marrow Transplantation/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer</em>               <sup>1</sup> sobre las infecciones fúngicas invasoras en trasplantados de médula ósea en 19 centros europeos, la incidencia de estas infecciones fue del 11.2%, y la mortalidad por candidiasis fue del 58%, por aspergillosis del 76% y por otras infecciones fúngicas del 54%.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">La anfotericina B (AB) se considera desde los años 50 el tratamiento de elección para la mayoría de estas infecciones, por tener un amplio espectro antifúngico y desarrollar mínimas resistencias; sin embargo, su utilidad clínica se ve limitada tanto por su toxicidad aguda (efectos relacionados con la infusión como fiebre, escalofríos, náuseas, vómitos) como renal, sobre todo en pacientes con función renal alterada y que reciben otros tratamientos nefrotóxicos (ciclosporina, aminoglucósidos, antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, foscarnet...)<sup>2-4</sup>.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Para reducir la toxicidad de la AB se han desarrollado recientemente formulaciones no convencionales (AB noC) que asocian la AB a lípidos<sup>5-7</sup>. En España disponemos de dos de ellas: la AB unida a verdaderos liposomas (ABM) y la AB en complejo lipídico (ABL). Los estudios publicados hasta el momento comparan eficacia y seguridad de estos nuevos preparados con la AB convencional (ABC); en ellos las AB noC parecen tener una eficacia clínica similar a la ABC pero una toxicidad inferior, tanto aguda como renal<sup>8-10</sup>. En 1998 se publicó un estudio retrospectivo observacional en el que se analizó la eficacia y seguridad de ambos preparados de AB no C en pacientes hematológicos<sup>11</sup>; no se encontraron diferencias significativas ni en eficacia ni en seguridad, excepto por una mayor proporción de reacciones agudas (tiritonas) en los pacientes que tomaron ABL frente a ABM; puesto que se trataba de un estudio observacional y no de un ensayo clínico aleatorizado, los resultados hallados precisaban de confirmación en un estudio experimental bien diseñado. Los dos ensayos clínicos disponibles que comparan las dos AB no C en pacientes neutropénicos, no encuentran diferencias estadísticamente significativas en eficacia<sup>12-13</sup>; en lo que se refiere a la seguridad, en uno de ellos tampoco se encontraron diferencias significativas salvo que ABM se asoció a más alteraciones hepáticas<sup>12</sup>, y el otro mostró mejor perfil de seguridad a favor de ABM<sup>13</sup>. No obstante uno de los trabajos se realizó con una muestra muy pequeña de pacientes y ambos sólo se encuentran disponibles como resumen de congreso. Puesto que no se dispone de ensayos clínicos aleatorizados y ciegos con una muestra grande de pacientes, bien diseñados y publicados que comparen la eficacia y seguridad de las diferentes formulaciones asociadas a lípidos no es posible, de momento, asegurar si un preparado ofrece ventajas frente a otro.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Por otro lado, no todos los pacientes con infección fúngica grave se van a beneficiar de igual manera de la menor toxicidad de las formulaciones asociadas a lípidos, por lo que la elección del tratamiento debería basarse en la valoración individualizada de cada paciente, en especial su estado inmunológico y su función renal<sup>14</sup>. </span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Los preparados asociados a lípidos tienen además un coste muy elevado, existiendo grandes diferencias entre las AB disponibles, de modo que el coste/tratamiento/día de la ABM es aproximadamente 15 veces mayor que el de la ABC y 1,5 veces mayor que el de la ABL (a las dosis habitualmente recomendadas de 5 mg/kg/día de ABL y 3 mg/kg/día de ABM). En nuestro hospital, aunque en la práctica el uso de estos preparados está limitado a algunos servicios (Hematología y Oncología fundamentalmente) su utilización supuso en 1999 un coste de 134.057.425 millones de ptas, un 5% del gasto total en Farmacia. Es necesario, por tanto, que los médicos que atienden a estos pacientes dispongan de herramientas que les permitan optimizar sus decisiones terapéuticas, no sólo por criterios de eficacia y seguridad sino también de coste-efectividad. Dado el elevado coste sanitario derivado de la atención a los pacientes con infecciones fúngicas sistémicas, así como la gran morbilidad y mortalidad asociada, se plantea el siguiente estudio, con los objetivos de conocer la utilización de la AB noC (ABL y ABM) desde un punto de vista cuantitativo y cualitativo y evaluar la repercusión económica de su uso inapropiado en nuestro hospital.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">             <strong>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">SUJETOS Y MÉTODO</span></strong>           </p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">El estudio se ha realizado en el Hospital Clínico Universitario de San Carlos, entre julio de 1998 y septiembre de 1999. Es un centro con actividad docente que funciona como hospital terciario de referencia; cuenta con 1.100 camas y Servicios de Hematología y Oncología en los que se realizan trasplantes autólogos de médula ósea. </span></p> <ol type="1">     <li>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Elaboración de las normas de uso de la AB </span></li> </ol> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">En el momento de iniciar el estudio no existían normas explícitas para el uso de antifúngicos en el hospital, por lo que se planteó el trabajo en dos etapas: en la primera y con el fin de disponer de un patrón de referencia se desarrollaron unas 'Normas de uso de la AB en las infecciones fúngicas sistémicas'; en la segunda fase se evaluó, de forma retrospectiva, la concordancia entre la prescripción de la AB noC y las recomendaciones acordadas, así como la repercusión económica de su utilización. Estas normas, además, podrían servir posteriormente como instrumento para una intervención informativa que permitiera mejorar la concordancia entre la práctica y las recomendaciones recogidas en ellas. Para ello se reunió a un grupo de profesionales del hospital con amplios conocimientos del tema y experiencia en el manejo de los pacientes afectados, pertenecientes a los Servicios de Hematología, Oncología, Medicina Interna, Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos y Farmacia; el grupo de trabajo estuvo coordinado por los Servicios de Farmacología Clínica y Microbiología. </span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Se realizaron varias reuniones en las que se discutieron las recomendaciones que debían contener las normas de uso. Para ello, se realizó una revisión 'no sistemática' de la literatura y la elaboración de las normas se basó en el consenso entre los miembros del grupo de trabajo.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">En conjunto las normas sobre la utilización de la AB pueden verse en la tabla 1. La ABC se recomienda en los pacientes no neutropénicos<em> </em>(principalmente pacientes críticos sometidos a ventilación mecánica<em>) </em>con candidiasis sistémica o aspergillosis invasora, infección por <em>Mucor </em>spp<em>. </em>o<em> Fusarium </em>spp, y con función renal normal (Cr&lt;2.5 mg/dl). Si la función renal está alterada o se deteriora de forma progresiva con la utilización de ABC, se recomienda utilizar ABL. Se considera candidiasis sistémica cuando existe aislamiento microbiológico en líquidos estériles y la colonización por <em>Cándida </em>spp<em>. </em>en al menos tres localizaciones diferentes no estériles en pacientes en situación crítica con sintomatología infecciosa.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">En los pacientes neutropénicos tras quimioterapia intensiva o trasplante de médula ósea, en la infección sistémica por <em>Cándida </em>spp. o infección por <em>Aspergillus </em>spp.<em>, Mucor </em>spp.<em> o Fusarium </em>spp., así como en el tratamiento empírico del cuadro febril que persiste tras 5 días de tratamiento antibiótico de amplio espectro ó 3 días en pacientes en situación crítica, se recomienda utilizar una formulación de AB noC, ya que se trata de pacientes que toleran mal la toxicidad aguda de ABC y que requieren múltiples tratamientos nefrotóxicos concomitantes. Se recomienda la utilización de ABL por tratarse del preparado de AB noC con mejor relación coste/efectividad.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">La utilización de ABM quedaría restringida a aquellos casos en que el paciente no tolere los efectos indeseables de la ABL o presente deterioro de la función renal con Cr&gt;2.5 mg/dl tras tratamiento con ABL. </span></p> <ol type="1">     <li>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Evaluación de la calidad de la prescripción de la AB noC </span></li> </ol> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Con el fin de conocer la calidad de la prescripción de la AB noC antes de la difusión de las Normas de uso, se evaluaron los tratamientos prescritos con esta AB en el periodo de estudio, utilizándose las Normas anteriormente citadas como patrón de referencia.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Para delimitar el marco muestral se definió como unidad de estudio cada tratamiento con AB noC prescrito en el hospital durante el periodo comprendido entre el 1 de julio de 1998 y el 15 de septiembre de 1999, independientemente del diagnóstico. La información básica sobre cada tratamiento (nombre del paciente, tipo de AB noC prescrita, dosis y duración del tratamiento) fue facilitada por el Servicio de Farmacia del Hospital, así como el coste/mg (en pesetas).</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Para conocer la indicación de cada tratamiento y los datos clínicos necesarios para evaluar la calidad de la misma, se utilizaron las historias clínicas como fuente de datos.

Se realizó un análisis descriptivo de las variables de interés. Además se cuantificó el gasto derivado de la prescripción de la AB noC, así como la repercusión económica del exceso de gasto producido como consecuencia del uso incorrecto de la AB. Se consideró 'incorrecta' cualquier indicación no reconocida como tal en la literatura biomédica o no incluida en las Normas de Uso consensuadas y cualquier tratamiento en el que se prescribió una AB estando recomendada otra (por ej. la ABM estando recomendada la ABL o la ABC).</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">             <strong>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">RESULTADOS</span></strong>           </p> <ol type="1">     <li>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Evaluación cualitativa y cuantitativa de la prescripción de AB noC </span></li> </ol> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">El análisis descriptivo muestra que se prescribieron un total de 245 tratamientos con AB noC; en el 53% se utilizó ABL y en el 47% ABM.

El 88% del exceso de gasto (37 millones) se debe a la selección inadecuada de ABM en pacientes que podrían haber sido manejados con ABL o ABC, y el 12% (5 millones) a la selección de ABL en pacientes que no requerían ninguna anfotericina (aquí incluimos el debatido uso profiláctico en pacientes neutropénicos) o que podrían haber sido manejados con ABC. El exceso de gasto producido por la prescripción innecesaria de AB noC fue de 1.720.327 pesetas y el derivado de la prescripción de AB noC para la profilaxis de la aspergillosis fue de alrededor de 3 millones de pesetas (7% sobre el total).</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">             <strong>               <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">DISCUSION</span></strong>           </p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">El uso de la AB noC (ABL yABM) se ha incrementado notablemente en los últimos años en nuestro hospital. El desarrollo de las formulaciones de AB asociadas a lípidos (AB en complejo lipídico y AB en complejo liposomal) ha determinado además un cambio en el patrón de utilización de AB y una considerable variabilidad interpráctica a la hora de seleccionar la AB. En nuestro estudio se demuestra que, globalmente y desde una perspectiva clínica, el uso de AB noC fue adecuado pero poco eficiente.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">En el desarrollo de nuestro trabajo hemos encontrado varias limitaciones; en primer lugar, la falta de ensayos clínicos comparativos sobre eficacia y seguridad de las dos formulaciones de AB asociadas a lípidos no nos permite conocer si un preparado es mejor que otro. Los estudios que comparan una de las dos formulaciones con ABC han demostrado que ambas tienen una eficacia similar a la ABC con una menor incidencia de efectos secundarios<sup>8-10</sup>. Los dos ensayos clínicos disponibles que comparan las dos AB noC no encuentran diferencias estadísticamente significativas en eficacia<sup>12,13</sup> y son contradictorios en cuanto al perfil de seguridad, por lo que sería necesario contar con otros estudios realizados con un tamaño de muestra grande y bien diseñados. Asumiendo la escasa información disponible y teniendo en cuenta que el coste/tratamiento/día de ABM es 1.5 más elevado que el de ABL, utilizándolos a las dosis habitualmente recomendadas en la ficha técnica de cada preparado (5 mg/kg/día de ABL y 3 mg/kg/día de ABM), hemos considerado que ABL sería el preparado con una mejor relación coste/efectividad y por lo tanto la AB noC de elección.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Por otro lado, la principal limitación de la metodología utilizada para definir las indicaciones de la AB noC ha sido que la revisión de la literatura no fue sistemática y, por lo tanto, pudo estar sujeta a sesgos en la interpretación de los resultados. No obstante, el procedimiento se basó en el consenso y en la participación de todos los servicios implicados en la prescripción de AB, lo que habitualmente debería garantizar una amplia aceptación de las normas por parte de los prescriptores.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">La obtención de los datos a partir de la historia clínica ha sido otra limitación de nuestro trabajo. Aunque los estudios sobre calidad de la asistencia realizados en el medio hospitalario y extrahospitalario indican que cada vez se registran más datos en la historia clínica<sup>15</sup>, el elevado porcentaje de tratamientos inadecuados encontrados en nuestro trabajo, hace pensar en la posibilidad de que haya existido un sesgo de mala clasificación de los tratamientos. Dado que éstos se han clasificado como 'correctos' o 'incorrectos' de acuerdo a los datos registrados en la historia, es posible que la falta de algunos datos clínicos haya sobreestimado el porcentaje de tratamientos inadecuados. Sin embargo, creemos que este sesgo no invalidaría nuestros hallazgos dado que se necesitaría un número de tratamientos mal clasificados muy elevado para modificar el sentido de los resultados. No obstante, el registro cuidadoso de los efectos secundarios relacionados con la AB hubiera sido fundamental para justificar la selección de una AB noC en muchos casos. Los médicos deberían ser conscientes de la importancia de que este aspecto depende sólo de ellos y por tanto es fácilmente mejorable.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">También debe tenerse en cuenta que entre los tratamientos considerados incorrectos se encuentran aquellos casos en los que la AB noC se prescribió a dosis bajas en pacientes neutropénicos para la cuestionada indicación de profilaxis de la infección por <em>Aspergillus </em>spp.<sup>16-18</sup>. Es importante comentar que durante el primer semestre de 1998 se realizaron obras de reformas en el hospital y que éstas se han señalado en algunos estudios como factor de riesgo de infecciones por <em>Aspergillus </em>spp.<em> </em>en los pacientes neutropénicos<sup>19,20</sup>; por ello se acordó que el servicio de hematología prescribiría AB noC temporalmente a los pacientes neutropénicos como profilaxis de la infección por este microorganismo; esta situación se mantuvo hasta mayo del 99, momento a partir del cual dejó de recetarse para esta indicación. Aunque el número de tratamientos prescritos para profilaxis de infección por <em>Aspergillus</em> spp. fue elevado, el coste derivado de los mismos fue realmente pequeño. </span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">El exceso de gasto derivado de la prescripción inadecuada hace referencia al ahorro que se podría haber obtenido si sólo se hubieran realizado los tratamientos correctos. Se incluye en este grupo el exceso de gasto debido a una selección incorrecta de la AB noC, el que se ha debido a la prescripción coyuntural de AB noC como profilaxis de la infección por <em>Aspergillus </em>spp. y el que se ha producido como consecuencia de la prescripción innecesaria de AB noC. Llama la atención que la mayor parte de este exceso de gasto (más de 37 millones) se debe a la selección inadecuada de la ABM; esto sugiere que la puesta en marcha de intervenciones de carácter informativo sobre los prescriptores permitiría realizar una selección más eficiente de la AB noC y podría suponer un ahorro potencial de más de 30 millones de pesetas el próximo año, si la evolución del gasto permaneciera constante.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">No hemos encontrado estudios publicados en la literatura que nos permitan establecer comparaciones con los resultados obtenidos en nuestro trabajo, pero creemos que se encontraría también un incremento de consumo de AB y una distribución similar entre las dos formulaciones disponibles de AB noC.</span></p> <p>             <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Los resultados de nuestro estudio indican que la calidad de la prescripción de la AB noC no ha sido óptima. La falta de unas normas de uso explícitas es probablemente una de las causas que explican las diferencias de criterio encontradas; el desarrollo de las normas de utilización de AB y su divulgación pueden contribuir a racionalizar la prescripción y a reducir el coste innecesario.<br/> </span><span style="COLOR: green">[/body]<br/> [back]</span></p> <p>             <span style="COLOR: red">[other standard=other count='20']</span><strong>BIBLIOGRAFÍA</strong>           </p> <p>             <span style="COLOR: navy">[ocitat]</span><span style="COLOR: teal">[no]</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;

      <portal>         <p>           <strong>Guide for the installation of SciELO sites</strong> </p> <p>           <strong>Version March 2008</strong> </p> <p>The SciELO Model – Scientific Electronic Library Online (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>) is oriented to the publication of scientific journals in the Internet, with emphasis on those produced by Ibero-American countries. </p> <p>The SciELO Methodology is the first component of the SciELO Model. The second component of the Model is the SciELO Site that operates decentralized collections of scientific journals selected according to with previously established criteria. The third component is the SciELO Network that integrates the individual SciELO Sites.</p> <p>The SciELO Methodology includes a set of policies, standards, guidelines, procedures, and tools for the execution of the function of journal evaluation and selection, as well as for the preparation, storage, publication, preservation, control of use and impact of scientific journals operated through the SciELO Sites.</p> <p>The development of the SciELO Methodology is the product of the cooperative project between BIREME - the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information, FAPESP - Foundation of Support for Research of the State of São Paulo, CNPq - National Council of Cientific and Technological Development, and Brazilian editors of scientific journals, launched in 1997 and adopted subsequently by other countries in the region. In the area of health, the SciELO Model operates in the space of the <a href="http://www.bireme.br/bvs/I/ihome.htm">Virtual Health Library (VHL)</a> and the SciELO Methodology becomes the common methodology for the publication of scientific journals in the Internet. The methodology has or considers extensions and adaptations for other types of literature, for example, monographs, theses, etc.</p> <p>In the SciELO Model, the methodology is applied to the establishment and operation of collections of electronic journals organized according to geographical and/or thematic scopes. A collection in particular operated in the Internet under the methodology constitutes a SciELO Site. Examples of SciELO Sites:</p> <ul>     <li>In operation: SciELO Brazil SciELO Brazil (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/">http://www.scielo.br</a>),  SciELO Chile (<a href="http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_home&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso">http://www.scielo.cl</a>), SciELO Argentina (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.org.ar/">http://www.scielo.org.ar)</a> </font>, SciELO Colombia (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.org.co/">http://www.scielo.org.co</a> </font>), SciELO Portugal (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/">http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt</a> </font>) and SciELO Venezuela (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.org.ve/">http://www.scielo.org.ve</a> </font>) , in the national region, in all the areas of the knowledge; SciELO Cuba (<a href="http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php">http://scielo.sld.cu</a>) and SciELO Spain (<a href="http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_home&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso">http://scielo.isciii.es</a>), in the national region and restricted to the area of Health Sciences; </li>     <li>By matter: SciELO Saúde Pública (<a href="http://www.scielosp.org/">http://www.scielosp.org</a>), international site that it operates a collection of Ibero-American scientific journals on Public Health, including Bulletin of PAHO and of WHO and the collection SciELO Social Sciences English Edition; and</li>     <li>Initiatives in development: SciELO Costa Rica (<a href="http://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?script=sci_home&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso">http://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php</a>), SciELO Paraguay (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://scielo.iics.una.py/">http://scielo.iics.una.py</a> </font>) and  SciELO Uruguay (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.edu.uy/">http://www.scielo.edu.uy</a> </font>) in the national region and restricted the areas of Biological Sciences and of the Health; SciELO Mexico (<font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.scielo.org.mx/">http://www.scielo.org.mx</a> </font>) and SciELO Peru (<a href="http://www.scielo.org.pe/scielo.php?script=sci_home&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso">http://www.scielo.org.pe</a>)  in the national region and in all the areas of the knowledge. </li> </ul> <p>It is important to note that the SciELO Methodology can be applied to the operation of any individual journal or any journal collection. However, the establishment of a collection that is recognized as a SciELO Site requires that the titles are selected according to quality criteria defined in the document 'SciELO Criteria: criteria, policy, and procedures for the admission and permanence of scientific journals in the SciELO collection' (<font face="Arial"> <a href="/php/index.php?lang=en">http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php?lang=en</a> </font>). Collections of journals that do not obey the criteria of SciELO quality can be operated in the Internet using the SciELO Methodology. In this case, they are not recognized as SciELO Sites.</p> <p>The progressive application of the SciELO Methodology to operate in the Internet selected collections of scientific journals of the countries in the region will give rise to an integrated collection network decentralized from scientific journals - the SciELO Network, whose development will decisively help to increase the visibility and access to the scientific production of the region.</p> <p>A fundamental characteristic of the SciELO Model is the control of use of the journals in the Internet through the publication of statistics of use of the sites as a whole, of the titles of journals individually, their issues and articles. The methodology also permits the publication of bibliometrical indicators, especially the ones related to bibliographic references. The indicators of use and those of appointments will permit the monitoring of the impact on scientific journals operated in the SciELO Network. These performance indicators will make possible, among other applications, the evaluation of the permanence of the journals in the SciELO collection. Thus, SciELO represents an entity for the evaluation, monitoring, and improvement of the quality of the scientific journals of its collection.</p> <p>The establishment of a SciELO Site in the area of a country requires a series of conditions related to the quality of the journals and to the sustainability of its operation in the political aspects and of management, including, specifically, the financial aspects, human resources, infrastructure of technologies of information, promotion and marketing. For this it is necessary to have the leadership of one or more national institutions with a recognized role in the management of scientific research in general and of scientific communication in particular. When the SciELO collection covers all the scientific areas, it is important to have the decisive support of the national boards of science and technology, of the national academies of science, of the associations of scientific editors etc. When the collection is restricted to health sciences in particular, the institution leader should in addition be recognized by its role in research and scientific communication in health. In the area of health, the operation of SciELO collections should be integrated in the VHL.</p> <p>The establishment and operation of a SciELO Site in addition requires the cooperative participation of the editors and scientific publishers, and should be attended by an National SciELO Consultancy Committee that aims at ensuring the enforcement of the quality criteria, in addition to defining priorities and strategies of development. The Consultancy Committee should be formed by representatives of the editors and publishers and of the institutions of support for scientific research.</p> <p>In short, the establishment of a SciELO Site in a country requires an articulated cooperative action that should involve the active participation of the institutions and entities related, directly and indirectly, with national scientific communication. As a result of this articulation, an institution responsible for the operation of the SciELO Site is defined with the assistance of an National Consultancy Committee.</p> <p>The institution responsible for the operation of the SciELO Site should have a devoted administrative unit and the resources of adequate infrastructure, including physical space, human and technological resources. In terms of human resources the performance of the following functions is required: (a) general coordination, responsible for the project as a whole; (b) operational management, responsible for up-to-date and efficient operation of the SciELO Site work flow; (c) technical functions of librarianship, related to the treatment of full texts and metadata; (d) technical functions of system manager, related to the infrastructure and operation of data flow, hardware, software and communication. The establishment and operation of collections SciELO in regional or subregional area should take into account the same orientation in addition to other specific demands.</p> <p>It is recommended that the establishment of a SciELO Site begins with an experimental period from 3 to 8 months with selection from 4 to 7 scientific journals that are due to the criteria of selection SciELO. The pilot or experimental operation has as the objective of developing the local capacity of the unit in use of the SciELO Methodology for the operation of the flow of work of the SciELO Site.</p> <p>After the initial stage, the regular operation of the SciELO Site should be continually attended by the National SciELO Consultancy Committee, in particular with respect to the income of new titles of journals in the collection and the permanence of the titles already selected according to their performance.</p> <p>The selection criteria of titles for a collection SciELO are described in the document ' SciELO Criteria: criteria, policy, and procedures for the admission and permanence of scientific journals in the SciELO collection' (<font face="Arial"> <a href="/php/index.php?lang=en">http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php?lang=en</a> </font>). The criteria aimed at evaluating the scientific nature of the journal, that is, predominant communication of results of original research. In short, in order to ensure the scientific nature, the criteria request that the articles are arbitrated by peers (peer-review), the publishing body of the journal is representative of the speciallity, that has sustainability of the flow of articles measured by its annual volume and its distribution in terms of periodicity and punctuality of publication. The titles and summaries should be translated into English when the original text is not in English. Furthermore, the presentation of the journal and of the articles should obey international standards of scientific publication.</p> <p>The work flow of operation of a SciELO Site begins with the reception of the full texts in electronic format sent by the editors and/or publishers of the journals that compose the collection. The texts, converted to the HTML format, preserve the integrity of the text printed matter, and have their structure and bibliographic elements (metadata) marked following the ISO general standard 8879/1986 SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and specifically SciELO DTDs (Document Type Definition), available at &lt;<a href="/php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=4">http://www.scielo.org/<font face="Arial">php/level.php?lang=en&amp;component=42&amp;item=4</font> </a>&gt;. The marked texts are loaded on the basis of data for their operation in an Internet server. After the charge in the database, the metadata of the full texts are exported for external databases to SciELO, like as LILACS, MEDLINE, and the curriculum vitae of the authors in the databases of CVLACS, to provide dynamic links.</p> <p>           <a target="_blank" href="/local/content/image/fluxo_en.jpg">Click here</a> for a general view of the data flow in the operation of a SciELO Site:</p> <p>The principal nodes in the data flow are described briefly below: </p> <ol>     <li>the Unit SciELO receives the electronic files sender by the journals in different formats </li>     <li>if the files are already in HTML they are sent directly for the process of marking and final verification of the HTML </li>     <li>if the files are not in HTML they are sent for the conversion to HTML </li>     <li>with the files all in HTML format the final verification of the files included there, the integrity of the text, the link for the images, and then the marking of the structure and of the bibliographic elements of the text are made </li>     <li>the files are loaded in a local database, in which they will be quality control carry out </li>     <li>once the quality control is made, the database will be available in the Internet so that the users can access it </li>     <li>with the SciELO database loaded, will be sent the metadada for the external databases and the links are generated with external sources of information. </li> </ol> <p>BIREME, in particular, cooperates in the process of establishment of SciELO Sites through the dissemination of the SciELO Model among the community of authorities and professionals related with scientific communication in general and in health sciences. Once the conditions for the establishment of a unit for the operation of a SciELO Site, are accepted BIREME promotes together with the responsible national institution a workshop on training in the SciELO Methodology as the starting point for the beginning of the operations. Following the workshop on training, it follows a period of pilot operation that can take from 3 to 12 months until the normal operation of a SciELO Site integrated in the SciELO Network is reached.</p> <p>The operation of the SciELO Network is currently summarized in the portal (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/">http://www.scielo.org</a>), that refers to the different SciELO Sites in operation, and make available all the documentation about SciELO Methodology. In the future the SciELO Network will permit the recovery and navigation in the set of SciELO collections, in addition to producing indicators of use and impact. In the area of health sciences, the SciELO Network will be progressively and dynamically integrated in the network of sources of information on the VHL. </p> <p>The SciELO Model and more specifically the SciELO Methodology are in constant development in order to respond with efficiency to the specific demands of Latin American and the Caribbean countries and at the same time, to accompany the international developments in scientific communication in the Internet.

It is designed for technical personnel involved in producing the electronic publication of selected journals that comprise the national SciELO collection. </p> <p>It is conducted by experienced lecturers, and the course includes didactic material and technical support in order to solve any queries. By the end of the course, each participant is granted a certificate of participation.</p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>Program</strong> </p> <p>The Training Workshop on SciELO Methodology is composed of three modules with theoretical and practical classes, so that the participants learn to manage the software used to process data according to SciELO Methodology, from describing the journal in database to publication in the journal website: </p> <p>Module 1 - The SciELO Model of electronic publication<br/> This module presents the bases of SciELO Model and the Methodology software used to publish electronic documents.</p> <p>Module 2 - Data processing with SciELO Methodology<br/> This module demonstrates the preparation of electronic files, installation and use of the Methodology software; there are practical classes on software use.</p> <p>Module 3 - Publication of journals according to SciELO Model<br/> This module creates the website interface by means of the database produced in the previous module and performs quality control of the final result.</p> <p>The minimum hour load expected for the workshop is 35 hours, distributed in 5 classes lasting 7 hours each. The number of participants is limited to a group of 10-12 students.</p> <p> </p> <p>           <strong>Minimum Requirements</strong> </p> <p>Before starting the course, the institution in charge of its organization must comply with the following requirements:</p> <p>1.
